# Composer Go Maintenance

External composer command to put a WordPress website in maintenance mode the WordPress way.

# Disclaimer

This is deeply based on our current project's structure, so WordPress in `/wp/` and maintenance file in `tools/maintenance.model`.
Nevertheless you can override paths with additional arguments in command lines.

# What ?

A simple command to activate / deactivate maintenance mod.

# Example of .maintenance model

This allows you to skip WordPress maintenance mode. The rest of the World will get maintenance page :

```PHP
<?php
if ( 'REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_IP' !== $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'] )
    $upgrading = time();
?>
```

# How ?

## 1 - Add to [Composer](http://composer.rarst.net/)

- Add repository source : `{ "type": "vcs", "url": "https://github.com/BeAPI/composer-go-maintenance" }`.
- Include `"beapi/composer-go-maintenance: "dev-master"` into your composer.json file as require dev.
- Then `composer update` before use.

## 2 - Run command 

Then you can launch `composer go-maintenance start` to enable maintenance mode and reciprocally `composer go-maintenance stop` to disable maintenance mode.

Optionally you can override paths e.g :

`composer go-maintenance start wp tools/maintenance.model`

*If you use these additional parameters, please make sure you use relative paths in command lines.*
*Also make sure your model file is named 'maintenance.model'*

Optionally you can create a file called `maintenance.php` at the root of your WordPress content dir e.g `wp-content/maintenance.php`.
This is a good way to customize maintenance page displayed in WordPress by default.
